# ML-1-python-House-price--advanced-regression-Techniques
This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is trained on a dataset of house listings, and the goal is to provide a quick, interpretable solution to estimate house prices using a simple linear model.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic linear regression model applied to a real-world problem: predicting the price of a house based on selected features. Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, price) and one or more independent variables (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms). This repository can serve as a foundation for exploring more advanced predictive models.

Features
The following features are used to predict house prices:

Square footage - Total area of the house in square feet
Number of bedrooms - Total number of bedrooms in the house
Number of bathrooms - Total number of bathrooms in the house
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Required packages listed in requirements.txt
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the model and make predictions:

Ensure you have a dataset file (in CSV format) with columns for SquareFootage, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Price (if available).

Run the following script to train and test the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --data_path path/to/your/data.csv
Use predict.py to make predictions on new data:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --square_footage 1500 --bedrooms 3 --bathrooms 2
Example Prediction
bash
Copy code
$ python predict.py --square_footage 2000 --bedrooms 3 --bathrooms 2
Predicted Price: $350,000
Dataset
Provide details about the dataset here, or instructions on how to obtain it if it's not included in the repository.

Source: Example - Kaggle House Prices Dataset
Columns:
SquareFootage: Total square footage of the house.
Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house.
Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house.
Price: Price of the house (for training).
Model Training
The model is implemented using scikit-learn's LinearRegression. The train_model.py script splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the model on the training set, and evaluates it on the test set.

Model Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score to understand its accuracy in predicting house prices.
